# RuneScape Bot Interface

## Project Overview
The RuneScape Bot Interface is a web-based application designed to assist players in the popular MMORPG, RuneScape. With this interface, users can capture the game client area, track their bot runtime, and manage simple bot actions like starting and stopping the bot. The tool aims to automate repetitive tasks, providing an enhanced gaming experience.

## Installation
To set up the RuneScape Bot Interface locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd runescape-bot-interface
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**
   No further installation is required as the application runs entirely client-side.

## Usage
1. **Capture the Game Client:**
   - Click on the "Capture Game Client" button to select the area of the RuneScape client you wish to capture.
   - Click and drag to define the capture area, then release the mouse.

2. **Start/Stop the Bot:**
   - Once the client area is captured successfully, you can start the bot by clicking the "Start Bot" button.
   - To stop the bot, click the same button again (which will change to "Stop Bot").

3. **Monitor the Bot Runtime:**
   - The bot runtime is displayed prominently at the top, showing the elapsed time since the bot started.

## Features
- Capture the area of the RuneScape client for bot automation.
- Real-time display of runtime.
- Start and stop bot functionality via a user-friendly interface.
- Status indication for bot activity.
- A responsive design using Tailwind CSS for modern aesthetics.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following external libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for styling.
- **Font Awesome** (via CDN) for iconography.

No additional package managers or installations are needed, as these libraries are included using CDN links in the `index.html` file.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
/runescape-bot-interface
├── index.html          # The main HTML file containing the UI
├── bot.js              # The JavaScript file containing the bot logic
├── styles.css          # The CSS file with custom styles and animations
```

### HTML
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the interface including buttons, overlays, and display areas.

### JavaScript
- `bot.js`: Implements the bot functionality, including capturing the game client and managing bot actions.

### CSS
- `styles.css`: Provides custom styles and animations, enhancing the overall user interface look and feel.
